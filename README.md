**BLISS CUSTOMER SALES REPORT**

**Introduction**

This project presents an analytical review of the sales performance of BLISS NIGERIA, a retail company operating within the Nigerian market. The primary objective is to assess trends and shifts in customer behaviour, with a particular focus on gender-based patronage patterns over a specified period.
Using Microsoft Excel as the analytical tool, the dataset was meticulously cleaned to remove inconsistencies and errors, processed for uniformity, and validated to ensure accuracy and reliability. The data was then subjected to various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights, followed by structured formatting and visualization to effectively communicate findings.
By examining variations in sales data across gender lines, this analysis aims to uncover actionable insights that can support strategic decision-making such as targeted marketing, inventory planning or customer engagement strategies and ultimately contributing to enhanced business performance.

**Data Processing Workflow**

The analysis followed a structured workflow to ensure the dataset was accurate, relevant, and ready for insight generation. The key steps involved are outlined below:

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Standardized Gender Values: Ensured consistency in the Gender column by standardizing entries (e.g., "M", as "Male", and "F" as "Female").
- Date Transformation: Extracted Year, Month, and Day of the Week from the Order Date column to enable time-based analysis.
- Customer Age Calculation: Calculated customer Age from the Birth Date column.
- Age Group Classification: Categorized customers into age groups (Young Adult, Adult, Senior, Elderly) for demographic analysis.
  
**Data Analysis**
- Conducted descriptive and comparative analyses to explore trends in customer behaviour.
- Developed visualizations (tables and charts) and performed key calculations to answer targeted business questions especially regarding changes in gender patronage and age demographics.

 **Business Case Questions:**
1.	What is the total number of unique customers in the dataset? 
2.	What is the total revenue generated? 
3.	What is the demographic breakdown of our customer base in terms of gender, and how many customers are male versus female? 
4.	What portion of revenue is generated by male customers compared to female customers, and what insights does this provide for targeted marketing? 
5.	What are the trends in yearly revenue, and how can these trends inform our future forecasting and strategic planning? 
6.	How does revenue vary by season, and what does this reveal about seasonal demand patterns? 
7.	What percentage of total revenue is contributed by each age group, and what does this tell us about high-value customer demographics? 
8.	What are the usage patterns of different payment methods among male and female customers, and how can we leverage this information to improve the payment experience? 

**Tools Used**

 Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Analysis & Calculations, Data Visualization)

**Insights**

The project reveals distinct gender-based and seasonal trends in customer patronage. Notably, there is an imbalance in gender demographics, with a clear pattern in how different genders engage across seasons.

**Recommendation**

Implement targeted incentives aimed at increasing engagement among female customers. This approach can help address the gender imbalance and potentially enhance overall customer retention and satisfaction
